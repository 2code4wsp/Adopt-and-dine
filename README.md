# Fetch Your Furry Friend

## Description

With so many dogs in the world in need of a good home, and so many homes full of lonely people pining for the companionship that only a dog can provide, we have set about creating a place to match pets to homes. If we can provide you a place to not only find, but learn about your new dog breed, facts, and discover groups of different types of dogs we will have truly done our job. It is a growing need to have more responsible warm homes with open arms for pets, and we hope to place deserving pups in loving homes. Powered by the Petfinder API and the Dog API.
