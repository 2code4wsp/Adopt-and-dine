# Adopt&dine

## Description

With so many dogs in the world in need of a good home, and so many homes full of lonely people pining for the companionship that only a dog can provide, we have set about creating a place to match pets to homes. If we can provide you a dog to take home and look up information that is pertinent to their well-being, then Fetch Your Furry Friend will truly have done our job.  Powered by the Petfinder API and the Dog API.
