# Adopt&dine

## Description

With so many dogs in the world in need of a good home, and so many homes full of lonely people pining for the companionship that only a dog can provide, we have set about creating a place to match pets to homes.  And if we can provide you a place to take your new pet to dinner or brunch, then those of us contributing to Adopt&dine will truly have done our job.  Powered by the Petfinder API and the Yelp API.
