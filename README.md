# Fetch Your Furry friend

## USER STORY
As someone who wants to rescue a dog and learn some fun facts afterwards;

I want to be able to search for dogs available for adoption based on the zip code of my choice, and find some facts based on breed or random facts purely about dogs;

So that I can take care of my new dog to the best of my abilities to give them the care they deserve.


## DESCRIPTION
With so many dogs in the world in need of a good home, and so many homes full of lonely people pining for the companionship that only a dog can provide, we have set about creating a place to match pets to homes. If we can provide you a dog to take home and look up information that is pertinent to their well-being, then Fetch Your Furry Friend will truly have done our job.  Powered by the Petfinder API and the Dog API.
