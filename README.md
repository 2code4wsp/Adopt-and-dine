# Fetch Your Furry friend

##USER STORY:
As someone who wants to rescue a dog and learn some fun facts afterwards;

I want to be able to search for dogs available for adoption based on the zip code of my choice, and find some facts based on breed or random facts purely about dogs;

So that I can take care of my new dog to the best of my abilities to give them the care they deserve.

## Description

With so many dogs in the world in need of a good home, and so many homes full of lonely people pining for the companionship that only a dog can provide, we have set about creating a place to match pets to homes.  And if we can provide you a place to take your new pet to dinner or brunch, then those of us contributing to Adopt&dine will truly have done our job.  Powered by the Petfinder API and the Yelp API.
